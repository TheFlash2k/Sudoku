# Sudoku
A sudoku game made in C++

This game was assigned to me as a semester end project. I made this entirely in C++.

The game requires 10 table to be in the same folder as the build itself in order to run successfully.

Tables are also provided. But you can create your own tables and modify the program accordingly.

Also a .exe has been uploaded if you just want to test the game without building it and wasting time.

If you remove the CheckTableFilesExist() function and run the program without the tables, empty tables would show up as there
is no pre-defined table in the program.
