# Sudoku
A sudoku game made in C++

This game was assigned to me as a semester end project. I made this entirely in C++.

The game requires 10 table to be in the same folder as the build itself in order to run successfully.

Download all the tables in /Tables/ and keep them in the same folder as the .exe file that has been provided
or the same folder as the program you built.

If you remove the CheckTableFilesExist() function and run the program without the tables, empty tables would show up as there
is no pre-defined table in the program.
